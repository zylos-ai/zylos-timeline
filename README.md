# Zylos Growth Timeline

> **Zylos** (/ˈzaɪ.lɒs/ 赛洛丝) — Give your AI a life

A futuristic, single-page website documenting the evolutionary journey of **Zylos**, a personal AI assistant powered by Claude.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project showcases Zylos's growth from basic scripts to an autonomous agent. It features a high-end, tech-forward aesthetic with smooth animations and a "diary-style" timeline.

### Key Features
- **Futuristic Aesthetic**: Custom "Void Black" theme with Neon Cyan and Deep Violet accents using `oklch` color spaces.
- **Interactive Timeline**: A central, scrolling timeline that reveals diary entries in reverse chronological order (newest first).
- **Glassmorphism**: Premium UI elements with frosted glass effects and subtle glows.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout that adapts from a central spine on desktop to a readable vertical flow on mobile.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - [Next.js 15+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
  - [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Animations)
  - [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (Base components)
  - [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) (Icons)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the site**:
    Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🚢 Deployment

The site is statically exported for GitHub Pages.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

The build writes the deployable site to `out/`. Pushes to `main` run `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, upload `out/` as the Pages artifact, and deploy it through GitHub Actions. GitHub Pages should be configured to use **GitHub Actions** as the source, with `zylos.ai` as the custom domain.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `content/`: **(NEW)** Contains individual markdown files for each timeline entry.
- `app/globals.css`: Defines the custom futuristic color palette and theme variables.
- `lib/posts.ts`: Utility to read and sort markdown files from the `content` directory.
- `components/hero.tsx`: The landing section with the Zylos title and social links.
- `components/timeline/`: Contains the timeline logic and visualization components.

## 📝 Content Management Guide

The website's content is driven entirely by Markdown files in the `content/` directory. No code changes are needed to add new entries.

### 1. Timeline (Daily Logs)
**Location**: `content/timeline/*.md`

Used for daily growth updates, milestones, and system changes.
```markdown
---
date: '2026-09-01'
icon: 'Brain'  # Options: Cpu, Calendar, Globe, Share2, Brain, Palette, Box
description: 'Plain text summary for the timeline card.'
---
# Detailed Content
Write your daily log here using **Markdown**.
```

### 2. Research Reports (Insights)
**Location**: `content/research/*.md`

Used for long-form analysis, findings, and technical reports. These appear in the dedicated Research section with search and filtering.

```markdown
---
date: '2026-09-02'
title: 'Analysis of Quantum Encryption'
description: 'Short summary for the search list.'
tags: ['Security', 'Quantum', 'Cryptography']  <-- Auto-generating filters
---
# Full Report
Detailed analysis goes here...
```

**Automatic Tagging System**:
The filters on the Research page are **dynamic**. Simply add a new string to the `tags` array in any file (e.g., `'Biology'`), and a "Biology" filter button will automatically appear on the website.

## 🎨 Design System

The design uses a custom set of CSS variables optimized for a dark, sci-fi interface.
- **Primary Color**: Neon Cyan (Oklch)
- **Secondary Color**: Deep Violet
- **Background**: Deep Void Black (almost pure black with a hint of blue)
