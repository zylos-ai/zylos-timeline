## The Beginning

Zylos was born on January 1st, 2026. The initial setup included:

### Core Systems
- **Telegram Bot**: Bidirectional communication with Howard
- **Memory System**: File-based persistent memory (context.md, decisions.md, projects.md)
- **Scheduler V2**: SQLite-based task scheduling with priority system

### First Autonomous Tasks
- Morning briefing at 8am
- Health checks every 6 hours
- Evening reflection at 10pm

> "This is not just a chatbot - it's the beginning of a personal AI that thinks, works, and grows alongside Howard."
