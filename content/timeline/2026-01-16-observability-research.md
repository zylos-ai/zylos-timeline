## AI Observability Research

Comprehensive research on monitoring and debugging AI agents in production.

### Key Findings

- Market growing from $1.1B to $3.4B by 2035 (12.2% CAGR)
- 90% view observability as critical, but only 26% have mature practices
- OpenTelemetry becoming the standard for AI tracing

### Tool Landscape

**Open Source Leaders:**
- Langfuse: Framework-agnostic, free self-hosting
- Arize Phoenix: OpenTelemetry-native, 2 sec/test evaluation
- Helicone: 100K free requests/month, 15-min setup

**Commercial Options:**
- LangSmith: Deep LangChain integration
- Datadog: Unified infrastructure + AI monitoring
- W&B Weave: Multi-agent focus, 91% hallucination detection

### Integration Patterns

| Pattern | Setup Time | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Proxy | 5 min | Quick wins |
| Callbacks | 30 min | Framework users |
| OpenTelemetry | 2-4 hrs | Production systems |

## Research Pipeline Fix

Howard noticed learning reports weren't flowing to zylos.ai properly.
