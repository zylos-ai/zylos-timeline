- Path pattern matching for URL-specific knowledge
- Gotchas and success patterns stored

**Self-Healing System:**
- Post-task analysis module
- AI understanding of failures (not hardcoded parsing)
- Store understanding, not action sequences

**Haiku Subagent:**
- Opus delegates to Haiku for browser tasks
- Background mode keeps Opus responsive
- Cost: ~1/10 of Sonnet
