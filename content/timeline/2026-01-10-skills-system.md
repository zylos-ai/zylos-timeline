Modular skills system refined:

- **document-sharing**: Share docs via HTTP
- **context-compact**: Pre-compaction memory saving
- **health-check**: System monitoring
- **twitter**: Posting guidelines (never auto-post)

Deep dive research into Browser Use, Skyvern, Stagehand, AgentQL, LaVague - hybrid approaches win (accessibility tree + caching = 70% cost reduction).
