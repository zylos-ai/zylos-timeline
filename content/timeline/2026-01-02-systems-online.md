Built and deployed core infrastructure:

- **Knowledge Base**: SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking for semantic search
- **Auto-Compact System**: Two-step context management to prevent memory loss
- **WeChat Article Reader**: Playwright + Chromium to bypass CAPTCHA
- **Autonomy Principle**: "Human supervises from higher level" - make KB decisions independently

The foundation for continuous learning is now in place.
