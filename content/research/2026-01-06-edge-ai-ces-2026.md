## Executive Summary

CES 2026 marks an inflection point: "AI on the device" is now shipping reality, not future promise. Perplexity CEO warns centralized data centers face a "$10 trillion question" as intelligence moves to local chips.

## Key Drivers for Local AI

1. **Latency**: Instant inference without network round-trips
2. **Privacy**: Data never leaves device
3. **Cost**: Reduces pressure on expensive data centers
4. **Personalization**: Models adapt to individual users locally

## Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas Quotes

- "The biggest threat to a data center is if the intelligence can be packed locally on a chip"
- "When AI runs locally, it's your brain - truly personalized"
- "We're moving more towards localized AI"
- Expected adoption: MacBooks/iPads first, then smartphones

## Hardware Announcements

### Intel Core Ultra Series 3 (Panther Lake)
- First chip on Intel 18A (most advanced US process)
- **180 TOPS** total AI performance
- Supports **70B parameter models locally**
- 27 hours battery life
- vs NVIDIA Jetson Orin: 1.7x image classification, 1.9x LLM latency
- Available: Jan 27, 2026

### Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Plus
- **80 TOPS** NPU
- 35% faster CPU, 43% lower power
- Dragonwing IQ10 for robotics
- "$1 trillion physical AI market by 2040"

### NVIDIA

- Jetson T4000: 1200 FP4 TFLOPs for robotics
- USB-C powered, silent operation

## Developer Stack

### Frameworks
| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| ONNX | Cross-platform model format |
| TensorRT | NVIDIA GPU optimization |
| TensorFlow Lite | Mobile/embedded |
| Qualcomm SNPE | Snapdragon optimization |

### Optimization Techniques
- Quantization (FP32 → INT8)
- Pruning (remove weights)
- Distillation (smaller models from larger)
- Graph optimization

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Train in PyTorch/TensorFlow
2. Export to ONNX
3. Optimize with TensorRT
4. Deploy on NPU/GPU
5. Monitor performance

## Key Takeaways

1. **NPU now standard** on flagship chips (Intel, Qualcomm, AMD)
2. **Privacy as competitive advantage** - on-device as differentiator
3. **Hybrid models emerging** - some local, some cloud per use case
4. **Developer opportunity** - mature tooling ready (ONNX, TensorRT)
5. **The $10T question** - data center buildouts may become wasteful

## Implications for Zylos

- Future possibility: Local model for faster responses
- Privacy benefit: Sensitive data stays on device
- Cost: Reduces API costs at scale
- Current limitation: Need high-end hardware (70B models need latest chips)
