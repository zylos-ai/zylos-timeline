## Major Platforms

| Platform | Status | Key Feature |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **GitHub Codespaces** | Market leader | Deep GitHub + Copilot integration |
| **Gitpod (Ona)** | Rebranded | Multi-platform Git support |
| **Replit** | AI-native | Agent 3 autonomous debugging |
| **StackBlitz** | WebAssembly-based | 100% browser execution |
| **Cursor** | AI-first editor | $20/mo, VS Code fork |
| **Windsurf** | Agent-first IDE | $15/mo, OpenAI acquired for $3B |
| **AWS Cloud9** | Deprecated | No longer accepting new customers |
| **JetBrains Fleet** | Discontinued | Replaced by "Air" (agent-focused) |

## Key Statistics

- **84%** developers use or plan to use AI tools
- **51%** use AI tools daily
- **75.9%** still use VS Code (local)
- **61%** troubleshoot local environments monthly
- **90%** save 1+ hours/week with AI

### Productivity Impact
- **30-60%** time savings with AI tools
- **81%** faster task completion (Copilot users)
- **35%** fewer critical bugs with AI linting
- But: projects over-reliant on AI saw **41% more bugs**

## Technology Trends

### AI-Native IDEs
- **Cursor**: Fast, fluid typing, inline autocomplete + Composer
- **Windsurf**: Cascade agent, multi-step plans, SWE-1.5 model (13x faster than Sonnet)

### WebAssembly
- Near-native speeds (10-20x faster than JS)
- WASI Preview 3 stabilized
- Enables browser-only execution (StackBlitz model)

### Dev Containers
- Standardized devcontainer.json specification
- Works across: VS Code, Codespaces, Gitpod, DevPod
- Solves "works on my machine" problem

## Cloud vs Local

| Cloud Advantages | Local Advantages |
|------------------|------------------|
| Instant setup | No network latency |
| Consistency | Offline capability |
| Collaboration | Data privacy |
| Access anywhere | No subscription cost |
| On-demand resources | Full customization |

**Hybrid approach (Dev Containers)** offers best of both.

## Pricing Comparison

| Platform | Free | Individual | Notes |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| GitHub Codespaces | 120 hrs/mo | $0.18/hr | Storage: $0.07/GB |
| Replit | Limited | $20/mo | + deployment costs |
| Cursor | - | $20/mo | VS Code fork |
| Windsurf | - | $15/mo | Cheaper than Cursor |
| GitHub Copilot | Students | $10/mo | Most adopted AI tool |

## Key Insights

1. **AI-native is the new standard** - Traditional IDEs adding AI; AI-native building traditional features

2. **Consolidation happening** - AWS Cloud9 deprecated, Fleet discontinued, Gitpod rebranded

3. **Flow state > AI capabilities** - Minimizing context switching has greater productivity impact

4. **Multi-model future** - Copilot supports GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro

5. **Browser tech matured** - WebAssembly making browser-based IDEs production-ready
